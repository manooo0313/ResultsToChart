# ResultsToChart
It is an express app to transform Short Track Speed Skaters Competition Results into a Chart



This app will make a chart of the competitions results on each distance for each skaters.  

The data will look like this:

 Skater[
    {
    name: John Smith:,
    image: https://www.image.com/image.jpg,
    dateOfBirth: 12.12.2002,
    competitions: [
        {
           competition:[
              {
              name: Zagreb Cup,
              date: 13.11.2018.,
              distanceResults:[
                {
                  1500m: 2:34,234,
                  1000m: 1:37.987,
                  500m: 44,123
                }
                ]
              }
            ],
            competition:[
              {
              name: Belgrade Cup,
              date: 01.12.2018.,
              distanceResults:[
                 {
                   1500m: 2:34,234,
                   1000m: 1:37.987,
                   500m: 44,123
                 }
                 ]
              }
            ]
           }
           ]
        }
        ]
        
        
So the skaters can go to different competitions and they can skate different distances and not necessarly 3 distance per competition.
SO at the end from all that data I will make a chart.

If you have some idea or you have a feeleing that you can help me with this project don't hesitate to contact me.

Thanks for reareading!
